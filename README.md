## ðŸ‘‹  Hello there!

I love coding as a way to experiment, express, and occasionally break things in creative ways. While web development is my home base, Iâ€™m always stepping out to explore different tools and gain a system-wide perspective, thatâ€™s where the real growth (and fun) happens. In my downtime, Iâ€™m learning Japanese, binging anime, and diving into 3D graphics and gaming. ðŸ˜Š
